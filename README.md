- 👋 Hi, I’m @CelloSerenity
- 👀 I’m interested in ... iOS/iPadOS sideloading, emulators, JIT, GitHub.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, GitHub practices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any PRs I send.
- 📫 How to reach me ... TBD (I'm under 18 and very strict about my privacy. We'll see.)
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm sleep deprived.

A little bit about me- I've loved everything about coding from a very young age, but only very recently have had the time/resources to explain my knowledge past the "Scratch" blocks I grew up with. Recently, I have been able to learn a little more. Currently working on Python at school, and markdown/html/css (documentation) and learning to use GitHub in my spare time (which I don't have much of).

What's next for me: C++, we'll see what else.

PSA- I love SideStore!

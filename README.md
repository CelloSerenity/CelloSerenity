- 👋 Hi, I’m @CelloSerenity
- 👀 I’m interested in ... iOS/iPadOS sideloading, emulators, JIT, GitHub.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, Markdown (new to GitHub), relearning html.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any PRs I send.
- 📫 How to reach me ... TBD (I'm under 18 and very strict about my privacy. We'll see.)
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm sleep deprived.

A little bit about me- I've loved everything about coding from a very young age, but only very recently have had the time/resources to explain my knowledge past the "Scratch" blocks I grew up with. Currently working on Python in my schooling, and html/markdown/documentation/GitHub practices in my spare time (which I don't have much of for the time being). Future projects: C++, we'll see.

PSA- I love SideStore!

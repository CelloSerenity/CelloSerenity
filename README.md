A little bit about me- I've loved everything about coding from a very young age, but only very recently have had the time/resources to expand my knowledge past the "Scratch" blocks I grew up with. Recently, I have been able to learn a little more--currently working on Python at school, Markdown/html/css (documentation) and learning to use GitHub in my spare time.

What's next for me: C++, we'll see what else.
My iOS setup: SideStore (sorry Alt), StikDebug, LiveContainer
